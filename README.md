# Kayak Airlines Webscraping
Explore the factors responsible for Kayak Airline pricing using Selenium Web Scraping.

The goal of this project is to build a web scraper that performs searches on Kayak flight prices between the dates 06-Sept-2019 and 10-Sept-2019 for three different destinations: 
- NYC to LAX (random)
- NYC to BOS (closest)
- NYC to PER (farthest)

Using selenium for webscraping, extract the following features: 
- To-start, From-end
- To-time, From-time
- To-duration, From-duration 
- To-carrier, From-carrier
- To-#stops, From-#stops
- To-aiportStop, From-airportStop
- Sort : Best, Cheapest, Quickest
- Price
