# Kayak Airlines Webscraping
Explore the factors responsible for Kayak Airline pricing using Selenium Web Scraping.

The goal of this project is to build a web scraper that performs searches on Kayak flight prices between the dates 06-Sept-2019 and 10-Sept-2019 for three different destinations: 
- NYC to LAX (location far from NYC on US map)
- NYC to BOS (location closest to NYC)
- NYC to PER (location farthest from NYC globally)

Use selenium to webscrape and extract the following features:
- To-start, From-end
- To-time, From-time
- To-duration, From-duration 
- To-carrier, From-carrier
- To-#stops, From-#stops
- To-aiportStop, From-airportStop
- Sort : Best, Cheapest, Quickest
- Price

### Goals
- identify the factors responsible for different flight prices
- understand how Kayak categorizes a flight sale as "Best" 
- understand how Kayak structures their airline pricing to help users strategize their purchases and get the best deals
